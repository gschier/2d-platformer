==================
## Demo

[gschier.github.com/base-2d-platformer](http://gschier.github.com/base-2d-platformer/)

## Setup

Simply `git clone` the repo and open `index.html` in your browser (I only tested in Chrome).

## Functionality

This basic 2D platform game was built from scratch using HTML <canvas> and Javascript. The basic features include:
- Movement
- Gravity
- Jumping
- Framerate independant movement mechanics
- Collision detection

You will find config options for the following scattered throughout the code.
I will make configuration easier eventually. The more advanced features include the following:
- n-jumping (double jump, tripple jump, ...)
- sticking to walls
- time manipulation (slow down, speed up)

## Future Plans

So far this is just a start, here's a list of things I want to do next:
- Camera support
- Trigger zones
- Lots of other stuff
