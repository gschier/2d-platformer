## Demo

[gschier.github.com/base-2d-platformer](http://gschier.github.com/base-2d-platformer/)

## Requirements

- Have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed

## Setup

``` bash
$ # cd to root of project
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ # visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser
```

*To get memory stats to work start Google Chrome with the "--enable-memory-info" flag*

## Functionality

This basic 2D platform game was built from scratch using HTML <canvas> and Javascript. The basic features include:
- Movement
- Gravity
- Jumping
- Framerate independant movement mechanics
- Collision detection
- Canvas size independent (everything scales properly)

You will find config options for the following scattered throughout the code.
I will make configuration easier eventually. The more advanced features include the following:
- n-jumping (double jump, tripple jump, ...)
- sticking to walls
- time manipulation (slow down, speed up)

## Future Plans

So far this is just a start, here's a list of things I want to do next:
- Sequential level flow
- More trigger types
- A lot more
